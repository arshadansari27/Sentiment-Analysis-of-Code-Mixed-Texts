	abstract = {This paper presents a new idea for sentiment analysis in twitter, especially for the Indian users.
Sentiment analysis is one of the best tool to measure sentiments of the users hidden behind their text. But it is possible
that sentiments are not analysed successfully due to some barriers.Indeed, the task of automatic sentiment recognition
in online text becomes more difficult for all the aforementioned reasons like limited size of character i.e. 140, unlimited
spelling mistakes, slang words and different languages. In our research, the primary and underlying idea is that the fact
of knowing how people feel about certain topics can be considered as a classification task and removing the language
barrier using Google Translator. Twitter is used for the collection of data corpus in multilingual. Collected raw dataset
is transformed into standard language i.e. English, and used for polarity classification of data corpus. Hence, we present
how sentiment analysis can assist different languages, by Google translator and experimental results on the Naive
Bayes Classifier and Maximum Entropy classifier and comparison the results of these two. Experimental results show
that our proposed techniques are efficient and performs better than previously proposed methods. We worked with
Hinglish, however, the proposed technique can be used with any other language.},

	abstract = {Due to the advent of social media and networking
sites, people now have the opportunity to communicate with each
other more easily and frequently than ever before. The analysis
of the content of these communications can lead to numerous
benefits to the governments and corporations across various
industries. These will allow them in gauging the public sentiment
on a multitude of items and issues, on which they can take
necessary actions. However, to do so, one needs to decipher the
content which is usually in the form of a complicated mix of
multiple languages. In Indian social media, users often combine
Romanized English with their mother tongue language for
communications. In this paper, we have presented a number of
techniques to identify the sentiment of text after normalizing the
influence of multiple languages.},
